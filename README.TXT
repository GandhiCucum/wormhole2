THIS IS A STRIPPED-DOWN VERSION OF THE WORMHOLE2 SOURCES!

Because of license issues with the VSTSDK from Steinberg,
this package only includes code plasq.com built.

In order to build Wormhole2, you need to have the right
to view the VSTSDK. That means having signed the NDA with
Steinberg for the VSTSDK.

If have signed that NDA, and need to be able to build the plugins, 
please contact support@plasq.com to get a complete package
ready to build.
