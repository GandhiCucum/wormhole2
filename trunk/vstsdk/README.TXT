In this folder you need files from the VSTSDK 2.4.
plasq did some patching on them, so in order to
build WH2 you should get the correct files.

This is copyrighted by Steinberg 
If you did sign the NDA with Steinberg and are allowed to
have the VSTSDK, please contact support@plasq.com to get these files
