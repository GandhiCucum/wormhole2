Wormhole2 was original created by [http://plasq.com/wormhole plasq.com].

To compile the project, the VSTSDK 2.4 is needed plus some files which contain VSTSDK code. Unfortunately the sdk is not open-source. Please contact plasq if you have the VSTSDK 2.4 and need to build the plugin to get those additional files.
